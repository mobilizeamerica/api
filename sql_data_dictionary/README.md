# MobilizeAmerica SQL Mirror - Data Dictionary

The MobilizeAmerica SQL mirror is a feature we offer to our customers that enables them to access their
raw data. Our application has several CRM integrations and the ability to perform CSV exports, but
customers with sophisticated data operations may find it more convenient to extract data from our SQL
mirror. Use cases include performing analytics, creating dashboards and reports, and loading data into
data warehouses or Business Intelligence tools.

The data is continuously updated from our application's database in real-time so your queries will
always return the most current data, just like when you query the API.

Below you will find a comprehensive Data Dictionary of all the SQL views we currently provide with a
description of each field.
