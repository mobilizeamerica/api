# Overview
## API Entry Point

All requests occur through `https://api.mobilize.us/v1`.

## Format

APIs will return responses in JSON, with the following shared format.

| Field      | Type         | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data`     | array|object | Objects returned by the API (on this page).                                                                                              |
| `error`    | object       | Any errors with input or errors on the server. If this key is present, paging related keys will not be present, and data will be `null`. |
| `count`    | int          | If a paged response, the number of objects across all pages.                                                                             |
| `next`     | url          | The next page if it exists, otherwise `null`.                                                                                            |
| `previous` | url          | The previous page if it exists, otherwise `null`.                                                                                        |

## Authentication

For API routes which require authentication (not all do) you must access the API with a key which we will provide you. This key should be passed as the token in a bearer auth header, i.e.:


    Authorization: Bearer API_KEY

All requests must be made over HTTPS. Requests made with malformed, missing or otherwise incorrect API keys will return HTTP status 403.

## Errors

Error responses will have an object value for the `error` field and `data` will be `null`. We will also return a relevant HTTP status code with each error response.

Here’s an example error response for `/v1/events?organization_id=hello`:


    {
        "data": null,
        "error": {
            "organization_id": {
                "0": [
                    "A valid integer is required."
                ]
            }
        }
    }

## Paging

All endpoints support paging, using the query params `per_page` and `page`. `per_page` defaults to 25. In the response, `count` describes the number of total objects, so `ceiling(count / per_page)` gives the total number of pages. Also, for convenience, `next` and `previous` will be links to the next and previous pages respectively.

## Comparison Filters

Some endpoints will allow for filtering by comparing with a field within an object. In those cases, the format will be `field_name=cmp_####`. For example, to filter out events before Jan 1 2018 GMT, you can include `timeslot_start=gte_1514764800`. Multiple may also be used, e.g. `timeslot_start=gte_1514764800&timeslot_start=lt_1515110400`. The comparison operators are ≥ `gte`, > `gt`, ≤ `lte`, < `lt`. More may be added in the future.

For timestamp comparisons, the string "now" can be passed in place of a Unix timestamp to have the server compute the current time, e.g., `timeslot_start=gte_now`.

## OSDI compliance

OSDI is an exciting and important attempt to bring interoperability to the progressive data ecosystem, a cause we heartily support. However, there are a number of data model and format constraints of OSDI that made it a less-than-perfect fit for us and our consumers. While we have opted not to follow strict OSDI formats for our API responses at this stage, we have made our best effort to align field names and structure where possible. For example, many of the Event fields map directly onto OSDI field names. We hope this will make the job of anyone attempting to build an OSDI layer on top of our API easier.

The `email_addresses` list may be empty however if the Person is not affiliated with the requesting Organization, and the Person's affiliated Organization has restrictions on what volunteer data may be shared. This should generally only arise in the context of Attendance list endpoints, and not Person lists, since those should only return affiliated People anyway.

| --------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `primary` | bool   | Always true  |
| `number`  | string | Phone number |
